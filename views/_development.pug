      code.language-bash
        | git clone git@github.com:sdepold/feedrapp.git
        | cd feedrapp
        | yarn
        | yarn start

      | You can now run the app and start parsing your feeds:
      
    pre.language-text
      code.language-text
        | http://localhost:8080/?q=http://www.ebaytechblog.com/feed/

      | The easiest way to run your own dedicated version of feedrapp is probably via heroku:

    pre.command-line.language-bash
      code.language-bash
        | heroku create
        | git push heroku master
        | heroku open
